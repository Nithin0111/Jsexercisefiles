/*there are different datatypes also they are const if once const is declared it cannot override
for eg: we can override the value by this 
let firstName = 'jane';
firstName = 'joe' -> this overrides the above variable but if you use const you cannot override the value
eg:
const firstName = 'joe';
firstName = 'jane'; ->this gives an error so cannot use that*/
const firstName = "joe";//this value cannot be changed in entire program
console.log(firstName)
